# IOT-BASED-GARBAGE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Waste management is one of the first problems that the planet faces irrespective of the case of a developed or developing country. The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the next cleaning process. This in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor, ugliness and mosquitos to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. To avoid all such hazardous scenarios and maintain public health and cleanliness this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main theme of the work is to develop a smart intelligent garbage alert system for correct garbage management. This project proposes a smart alert system for garbage clearance by giving an alert signal via SMS. This process is aided by the two ultrasonic sensor which is interfaced with Nodemcu to check the level of garbage filled in the dustbin if it was more than 80 percentage then it sends the alert and another sensor was to automatically open and close the cap of the dustbin with the help of Servo motor and also it doesn’t respond if the garbage was  above 95 percentage in order to avoid overflow. For the transmission of messages, a message service Named ‘Twilio’ is used. The main motive of this project is to maintain a clean environment which enhances the rate of public health and reduces the rate of diseases.
